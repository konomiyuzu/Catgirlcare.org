        <p>Many people have questions regarding their catgirls,
            ranging from hilarious mishaps to very bad ideas. The
            developer(s) of this site decided to address a couple of them!</p>

        <span class="question">
            <h3>Is my catgirl broken? She keeps staring at me for no apparent reason.</h3>
        </span>
        <p>Don't worry, that's normal! Catgirls often stare at things,
            both living and inanimate, they are inteerested in. Your
            catgirl is clearly just curious of your daily routine.
            This is a good sign, because now you can try bonding with her
            by inviting her to take a closer look at what you are doing.
            Unless it's particularly complicated or dangerous, you can
            even try and get her to join you!</p>

        <span class="question">
            <h3>Can catgirls eat cat food?</h3>
        </span>
        <p>While most catgirls have been taught to eat human food,
            they can still eat food made for normal cats. However, try
            to avoid this as she may refuse to eat cat food.</p>

        <span class="question">
            <h3>How long is the average lifespan of a catgirl?</h3>
        </span>
        <p>The catgirl lifespan is heavily dependent on her breed,
            although most breeds can life for up to 90 years under
            good care. Some breeds, however, won't live much longer
            as your average cat.</p>

        <span class="question">
            <h3>My catgirl and I were caught by rain while walking home. Do you think I could help her hair and tail to dry by putting her in a microwave oven for just a little while?</h3>
        </span>
        <p>Your question has led us to believe that you aren't a suitable
            owner for your catgirl, and have put forward a request for the
            local police to pay you a visit. Any sane person knows that by
            putting her in a microwave oven she would die a cruel, painful
            death. We have put this question on the site to make sure similiar
            events won't happen in the future, as well as given a word to
            catgirl breeders to both teach the catgirls not to follow their
            masters' orders in such situations as well as let the new owners
            know this is strictly forbidden. No exceptions!</p>

        <span class="question">
            <h3>Do catgirls have a second pair of human ears?</h3>
        </span>
        <p>No! If your catgirl has human ears it is very likely that she is actually a human who is cosplaying as a catgirl.<br>
            The term <b>"four-ears"</b> is viewed as a <b>very rude insult</b> against catgirls, so please be thoughtful and avoid the topic around them.<br>
